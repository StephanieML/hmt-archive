title: HMT archive

The github repository at <https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive> is the central repository for archival data from the Homer Multitext project.

Prior to 2018, we used a gradle build system for assembling packages of published material that has passed final editorial review and verification into a unified representation in RDF.  That system is no longer used but is documented [here](groovy_builder).
