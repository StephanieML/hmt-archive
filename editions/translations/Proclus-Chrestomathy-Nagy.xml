    <p n="41"><milestone unit="line" n="12"/>The expedition gathers at Aulis for the second

    <p n="51">During a feast,

    <p n="52">and because of the bad smell 
        <milestone unit="line" n="23"/> is left behind on Lemnos;</p>
    <p n="53">and Achilles quarrels 
        <milestone unit="line" n="24"/> with Agamemnon</p>
    <p n="54">because he was invited too late.</p>
    <p n="55">Then when they disembark at Ilion,
        <milestone unit="page" n="105"/> 
        <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> the Trojans prevent them</p>
    <p n="56">and Protesilaos is killed by Hector.</p>
    <p n="57"><milestone unit="line" n="2"/>Then Achilles turns them back and kills Kyknos,</p>
    <p n="58"><milestone unit="line" n="3"/>son of Poseidon. And they bring away the corpses</p>
    <p n="59">and send an embassy 
        <milestone unit="line" n="4"/> to the Trojans, demanding Helen and the valuables.</p>
    <p n="60"><milestone unit="line" n="5"/>But since the Trojans do not comply, <milestone

    <p n="61">Going into the countryside, the Achaeans destroy 
        <milestone unit="line" n="7"/> the surrounding cities.</p>
    <p n="62">After this Achilles 
        <milestone unit="line" n="8"/> longs to have a look at Helen and</p>
    <p n="63"><milestone unit="line" n="9"/>Aphrodite and Thetis arrange a place for them to
                    meet.</p>
    <p n="64">Then when the Achaeans are eager to return home, 
        <milestone unit="line" n="10"/> Achilles holds them back.</p>
    <p n="65">He drives off 
        <milestone unit="line" n="11"/> the cattle of Aeneas</p>
    <p n="66">and destroys Lyrnessos and Pedasos and

    <p n="68"><milestone unit="line" n="13"/>Patroklos takes Lykaon to Lemnos and sells him</p>

    <p n="70">Then there is the death of Palamedes</p>
    <p n="71"><milestone unit="line" n="16"/>and Zeus’ plan to relieve the Trojans <milestone
