This is the central repository for archival data from the Homer Multitext project.

The repository includes a gradle build system for assembling packages of published material that has passed final editorial review and verification.


## Versions and branches ##

The master branch always has the most recent published release of the archive (currently, `2014-1`).

Work on the next publication is in a development branch named for the next release (e.g., `2014-2`).
