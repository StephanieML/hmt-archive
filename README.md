# The HMT archive #

This is the central repository for archival data from the Homer Multitext project.

Publishable archival data are in the `archive` directory.

Published versions are machine generated from data in that directory, and commited to the `releases-cex` directory.

For details about how the project is organized and managed, including how published datasets are released, see the web site at <http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-archive/>.
